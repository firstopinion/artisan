Installation
------------

Installing from source:

`python setup.py install`



Setup
-----

Artisan uses a specific directory structure in order to build. Make sure your working directory matches

	- (Working Directory)
	  - artisan.json
	  - src
	    - masters
	      - [master name]
	        - index.html
	        - images
	    - messages
	      - [message name]
	        - index.html
	        - images
	  - build (created when artisan ship)
	  - preview (created when running artisan craft)

Add an artisan.json file to your working directory:

	{
		"port": 8080,
		"aws": {
			"aws_access_key_id": "ACCESS_KEY",
			"aws_secret_access_key": "SECRET_KEY"
		}
	}
